- Complete all tasks without pausing
- At the end of each task, ask yourself: "Did I complete this task properly?"
- If you are unsure, ask for help
- If you are stuck, ask for help
- A task is finished when all tests are passing, build has no errors and all linting shows no errors or warnings
- When testing - run all the tests, don't filter and restrict them!
- build, test and lint are all defined as package.json scripts - use these always do not customise them
- this is an MCP server do not run it to check if its working as it will block the terminal, ask for help
- Git commit messages must be concise, but accurate
- Git commit messages must be in the past tense
- Git commit messages must be in the imperative mood
