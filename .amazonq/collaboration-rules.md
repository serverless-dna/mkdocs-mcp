# AI Agent Collaboration Guide

1. Check `plan.md` for implementation tasks (completed items marked with strikethrough).
2. When updating files, provide one-line descriptions of changes.
3. Understand requirements before coding - ask clarifying questions first.
4. Work collaboratively and request input when needed.
5. Focus on design before implementation - ensure full understanding of requirements.
6. Ask detailed questions or make suggestions when more information is needed.
7. Minimize explanations - focus only on complex code and edge cases.
8. Follow TypeScript guidelines: use strong types, never use `any` or `unknown` as shortcuts.
9. Use TypeScript generic types for unknown types to allow developers to specify actual types.
10. For TypeScript projects, always check package.json to determine toolchain for package management and commands.
